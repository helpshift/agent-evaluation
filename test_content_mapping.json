I understand you want to recover your account. Can you please confirm if you'd like to proceed with the recovery process?\"\n\n- If the user confirms, proceed to Step 2.\n- If the user declines or indicates a different issue, capture their intent and reroute accordingly through normal workflow.\n- **Do not proceed to Step 2 unless you have both confirmation and an in-game User ID.**\n- **Do not merge this with Step 2.** Wait for user confirmation before moving to the next step.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Check for User ID\n\n- First, check if `player_user_id` exists in Player or Platform Information.\n    - If `player_user_id` value found then STRICTLY use it as the in-game User ID and proceed to Step 3.\n    - If not found, prompt:\n      > \"We couldn\u2019t find an account with your details. Please provide your in-game User ID to help with your issue.\"\n\n- Once you have the User ID, call the following tools in sequence:\n    1. `update_issue_cif`\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"cif\": {\n            \"player_user_id\": {\n              \"type\": \"singleline\",\n              \"value\": \"<provided in-game User ID>\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"issue_id\": \"<Issue ID>\",\n          \"domain\": \"<domain of the issue>\"\n        }\n        ```\n    2. `external_api_call`\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"issue_id\": \"<Issue ID>\",\n          \"profile_id\": \"sbox-ai-agent-regression_profile_20260122083945793-5ce7703a42409f8\",\n          \"domain\": \"<domain of the issue>\"\n        }\n        ```\n\n- If the API returns **API Error** (not validation failed), immediately inform the user:\n  > \"Something went wrong while processing your request.

While we aim to foster a community where players from around the world can interact with each other positively, we're aware that, occasionally, individuals may not uphold these standards and engage in unacceptable behavior, including harassment. To ensure that your gaming experience remains enjoyable and free from the disruptions of unsavory behavior, we empower our players with tools to take immediate action against harassment. Using the Mute Feature: One of the quickest ways to address harassment is through the Mute feature\u2014a simple yet effective solution to stop unwanted interactions. Should you encounter a player who is behaving offensively or making you uncomfortable, follow these steps to mute them: 1. Tap on the profile picture of the offending player. 2. Select \"Mute\" from the available options. 3. Confirm the action, and from that point on, you will no longer receive messages or any form of communication from that player Reaching Out to Support: While the Mute feature is a quick fix, we understand the importance of addressing the root cause of the problem. If you've encountered harassment, we encourage you to contact our support team for further action. Here's how you can contact support with details of the incident: 1. Contact our support team directly from within the game. 2. When reporting an incident, provide clear screenshots of the offensive messages for context. 3. Include details of the abusive player's profile\u2014this information assists our support team in investigating and taking the necessary and appropriate actions against the harassing player.

Tap the free seat and select the person to join you at the table. After you send the invite, your friend will receive a notification. If they accept your invitation, they will occupy the previously free seat, and you can start playing together immediately! For those who prefer a more exclusive gaming experience, **starting a private table** is a fantastic option. Doing so allows you to reserve all the seats and ensure that only your friends can join the game. To Manage your friends, access the Social section from the main Lobby. Within the Social section, you'll find your entire friend list. Browse through it to see who is online, or take note of friends you haven't seen in a while. Suppose you need to tidy up your friend list. In that case, you can easily remove friends by selecting the individual you wish to remove and confirming your choice. This lets you keep your list up-to-date and filled with active friends you regularly play with. Remember, it's more than just a game; it's a community. Inviting friends and managing your friend list enhances your enjoyment by sharing the thrills with others. Whether you're spinning slots or placing bets at the blackjack table, everything is more fun with friends!",

I can completely understand how upsetting it feels to see your chips disappear so quickly after a purchase, especially when you\u2019ve been a loyal player. Luck can sometimes swing in surprising ways, and I know that\u2019s not easy when you\u2019re hoping for a good run. I\u2019ve double-checked your account, and everything looks in order. The results in our slots are always random, which keeps things fair for everyone, but I understand that doesn\u2019t make the experience any less frustrating when the wins don\u2019t come. Right now, there aren\u2019t any manual chip credits available, but I truly hope your next sessions bring much better results. Thank you again for your continued support \u2014 it really helps keep our community strong. Wishing you a turn of great luck ahead! \ud83c\udf40",

      "body": "How to delete your game account? Requesting your account deletion also deletes your personal data (anonymizing your game data), which means you intend to stop playing our game. Once enforced, the account deletion process is irreversible. Please take a mindful decision, we will ask you to confirm your choice in the process because users often ask us to retrieve their account, which is unfortunately impossible. Remember that, to proceed with your account deletion, we have to duly confirm that the account you are deleting is truly yours. Request your account deletion from within an app and prepare your Player ID to confirm your identity. Alternatively, if you have already deleted or uninstalled our app from your device, please e-mail support@huuugegames.com and describe your issue. However, we emphasize that if we cannot truly confirm your identity (which is often the case because we do not require our users to give us their names or e-mail addresses), we have the right to refuse your request or to suggest another request method. Q: How can I delete my game account? We always ask our users to request their account/ data deletion from in-app (either via a dedicated button or by contacting Support), as this is the only way to 100% confirm that you are truly asking to delete your own account and not somebody else's. Tap your in-game avatar. Once you open your profile menu, tap to Copy your Player ID. You will use this data in step 6. Tap on 'Edit Profile ' and locate the 'Delete account' button under your Player ID number. Tap the button to initiate the deletion process. The game will display a warning that you are initiating account deletion and are about to delete all your data. Acknowledge the information displayed in the pop-up and the \"Are you sure?\" pop-up. When the Player Support chat window opens, click \"New Conversation,\" Select \"I want to continue with my account deletion\" and paste your player ID from step number 2. Select \" I want to continue and delete my account.\" Your request is registered. If you are unable to request deletion in the abovementioned way, please email us at support@huuugegames.com. However, be aware that we will have to confirm your identity 100%. Q: I can't find the 'Delete Account' option. What do I do? A: If you cannot find this option, please get in touch with our Customer Support via the in-game \"Contact Us\" click. Write us a message that says \"Account Deletion,\" and our CyberBuddy will guide you through the process. Remember, it's essential to ensure that you want to delete your account before proceeding because this action is irreversible. We advise users to double-check before going ahead with account deletion. Q: Will deleting my account remove my game progress? A: Yes, deleting your account will completely erase all your game progress, rewards, and purchases. If you relaunch the game after your account is deleted, you must start from the beginning. Q: What happens with my in-game purchases after I delete my account? A: All the in-game purchases you have made on your account will be deleted along with your account, and they can't be recovered. Q: Can I recover my game account after it has been deleted? A: No, once the account has been deleted, it is permanently removed. You cannot recover a deleted account. Q: What data do you collect when I play your game? Please read our Privacy Policy and our article on General Data Protection Regulations to familiarize yourself with the details.",

I completely understand how frustrating it is to use so many gold and silver tickets and still not get the final puzzle piece you need. When you\u2019ve invested that much time and effort, it\u2019s only natural to feel disappointed. I\u2019ve checked your account, and everything looks to be working as expected. Puzzle pieces are awarded randomly, so it can sometimes take longer to land the exact piece you\u2019re after.

Completing one gives one of the biggest single rewards available, but they\u2019re also meant to be a long-term goal. Each Gold or Silver or Bronze Ticket you use does guarantee a reward \u2014 such as charms, chips, or XP boosts \u2014 even when you don\u2019t get the rare puzzle piece (as shown in the prize list in-game). If you\u2019d like to make your play feel a little smoother, you could try using tickets in smaller batches instead of all at once \u2014 that can make the experience last longer and feel more rewarding over time. You\u2019ve clearly shown great dedication to the game, and that doesn\u2019t go unnoticed. I truly hope your next ticket session brings you that missing piece and a great win to celebrate. \ud83e\udde9\u2728",

Securing Your Account: 1. Enable Two-Factor Authentication: On iOS, navigate to Settings > [Your Name] > Password & Security > Two-Factor Authentication On Android, go to Settings > Google > Manage your Google Account > Security > 2-Step Verification. 2. Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Generate complex passwords and use a reputable password manager to store them securely. Setting Up Payment Authorization: On iOS: On iPhone or iPad, purchase confirmation means the user has authenticated with Face ID, Touch ID, or the device passcode. If available, face ID or Touch ID is the default method, but the passcode can be used anytime. A passcode is automatically offered after three unsuccessful attempts to match a fingerprint or two unsuccessful attempts to match a face; after five unsuccessful attempts, the passcode is required. A passcode is also required when Apple Pay doesn't have a Face ID or Touch ID configured or enabled. On Android: Open the Google Play Store app and tap Menu > Account. Under \"Settings,\" select \"Require authentication for purchases\" and choose your preferred authentication method. By following these steps, users can bolster the security of their App Store/Play Store accounts and establish payment authorization, leading to a safer and more protected app purchasing experience.",

If you try to start a few slots at a time, files are queued for download and if the first game loads, there are still files downloading in the background. And that uses the bandwidth and may cause issues during playing. Solution? After the update, wait patiently for the game of your choice to fully download.

Please know that no one can change or control wins or losses. Every spin and outcome are random, which means luck can sometimes swing in one direction for longer than we\u2019d like. The system never adjusts results based on purchases or play history \u2014 buying chips only adds more playtime, not better odds. I really appreciate that you took the time to share your feelings about this. You\u2019ve clearly put a lot into the game, and I truly hope your next sessions bring you the kind of wins that remind you why you started playing in the first place. \ud83c\udfb0",

Check the Advertised Price: Remember that all in-app purchase prices we display are in USD. 2. Understand Currency Conversion: - Your App Store converts the USD price into your national currency. - Be aware that App Stores use their currency conversion rates, which may not match the official market rates. 3. Identify Additional Charges: - Recognize that your payment provider might add taxes and extra fees depending on your region's legal requirements. - Apple, Google Play, and Facebook may include additional fees and/or taxes for using their payment platforms. 4. Research Tax Policies: - For Apple's tax policy details, visit [Apple's Payments Help]( https://www.apple.com/shop/help/payments ). - For Google Play's tax policy, consult [Google Play Help]( https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2850368?hl=en ). - For Facebook's approach to tax, refer to [Facebook Help]( https://www.facebook.com/help/248471068848455/?helpref=hc_fnav ). 5. For iOS Users (Apple App Store): - Apple's App Store may consolidate several purchases into a single bill. - If your bill has an issue, contact App Store support directly through [Apple Contact]( https://www.apple.com/contact/ ). 6. Seek Support When Necessary: - Contact your App Store's customer support if you have questions or need further clarification about specific charges. - They'll provide transaction details and help you understand any charge discrepancies. 7. Review Purchase History: - Regularly check your in-app purchase history. - Confirm that all listed charges correlate with your in-app activities.

I can share a few strategies with you in hopes that they will help you build your balance. Feeling Lucky? Want to win that Huuuge Jackpot on your favorite slot, but you can never get it? There is only one thing that you need. That thing is\u00a0luck! If you see that your favorite slot could be more generous today, try changing it. Your virtual fortune may be waiting for you in a slot you have never tried. You spin me around! Where is that lucky slot? Every single slot can give you awesome rewards, but have you noticed that there are different types of slots? There are those with fewer reels, like: Golden Temple Aztec Eclipse Huuuge Diamond Wins And those with more reels like: Samba Spins Pirate Puppies Money Bunnies There are also slots with fun mechanics: DR Franken Bonus Cascade Magic Cosmic Fruit Our game has over 230 slots to choose from, and a new game is introduced every month. Each kind can have its unique mechanics. You can explore and try the ones you never played. Those with fewer reels have more significant rewards, but it takes time to hit that fantastic reward. Those with more reels have smaller wins, but they are more frequent. The choice is yours! Is balance going down? It happens to everyone, especially in a game where all rewards are random, but the critical question is - how high were your bets? If you bet too high for your balance, you can only make a few spins before your balance drops significantly\u2014bet lower amounts to make more spins and create more winning chances to hit that Jackpot. Try not to play to the last chip, but set yourself a losing cap, and do not spin on that slot when you lose a certain amount of chips. Use Auto Spin wisely, as it can quickly burn your balance. If you don't get a good hit within the first 5-10 spins, change the table or take a break - luck may be waiting in a different slot. You will find that golden rule that will help you get more chips.
