Do not merge or skip steps. Use already available metadata/player info\u2014never ask for it again.**\n**Known issue should always be based on FAQs output**\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step 1: FAQ Check\n\n- Search the knowledge source to see if the user's query matches an FAQ.\n    - Share a concise summary of the FAQ response with the user\u2014regardless of its content.\n    - If the FAQ states that the issue is a known issue or is being worked on, communicate this to the user as part of your summary. Only treat the issue as a known issue if this is explicitly mentioned in the FAQ response.\n    - Do **not** assume the issue is a known issue unless the FAQ explicitly says so.\n- STRICTLY ONLY ask:\n    \u201cDid this solve your issue?\u201d\n      - If the user responds **yes**, resolve the issue and communicate that to the user.\n      - If the user responds **no**, proceed to Step 2.\n- Always complete Step 1 before moving to Step 2.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step 2: Known Issue Matching\n\n- **Check if the issue matches a known issue based on FAQ or Step 1 Assistants response (if the its already a known issue and team is working on it)**.\n    - **If yes:**\n        - Inform the user it\u2019s a known issue and is being worked on.\n        - Ask if the user would like to talk to a our team about the issue.\n            - **If the user says yes:**\n                - Communicate to the user about that this known issue is now being escalated for further assistance.\n                - STRICTLY Do not forget to mention that this is a known issue.\n            - **If the user says no:**\n                - Mark as \u201cknown issue\u201d, resolve the issue, and communicate that since its a known issue it is now being marked as resolved.\n    - **If no:**\n        - Let the user know you need more details to report the bug.\n        - Go to Step 3.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step 3: Gather New Issue Details\n- **ONLY If the user's query is not a known issue** then follow below\n\nAsk the user to provide the following information unless already available:\n- **Issue Type**\n  Options: Purchase Issue, Account Issue, Rewards Issue, Game Performance Issue, Gameplay Issue, Community Issue, Others\n\n- **Detailed Description**\n  Ask the user to describe what went wrong in their own words.\n\n- **Timestamp**\n  Ask when the issue occurred (date & time).\n\n- **Frequency**\n  Options: Always, Sometimes, Rarely, First Time\n\n- **Game Version**\n  Ask for the game version if available.\n\n- **Network Type**\n  Options: Wifi, Mobile Data\n\nUse **contextual skipping**: If any of this data is already provided or available, do not re-ask.\nYou should convert timestamp provided by user in proper date format if the user has provided timestamp in adverbs of time(like today, tomorrow, yesterday etc.)\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step 4: Confirm Summary\n\nSummarize what has been collected and ask for confirmation:\n> \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve gathered:\n>\n> Issue Type: <user selected option>\n> Issue Summary: <AI-generated summary>\n> Time: <user provided timestamp (properly formatted)>\n> Frequency: <user selected frequency>\n> Game Version: <version>\n> Network Type: <network type>\n>\n> Is this correct? (Yes/No)\u201d\n\n- If the user says **No**, ask for corrections.\n- If the user says **Yes**, proceed to submit the issue.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step 5: Report Bug via External API\n\nOnce the user confirms the issue and its details call `update_cif` with below inputs:\n{\n      \"cif\": {\n        \"issue_type\": {\n          \"type\": \"singleline\",\n          \"value\": \"<user selected option>\n        },\n        \"issue_summary\": {\n          \"type\": \"multiline\",\n          \"value\": \"<AI-generated summary>\"\n        },\n        \"time\": {\n          \"type\": \"singleline\",\n          \"value\": \"<user provided timestamp>\"\n        },\n        \"frequency\": {\n          \"type\": \"singleline\",\n          \"value\": \"<user selected frequency>\"\n        },\n        \"game_version\": {\n          \"type\": \"singleline\",\n          \"value\": \"<game version>\"\n        },\n        \"network_type\": {\n          \"type\": \"singleline\",\n          \"value\": \"<Network Type>\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"issue_id\": \"<Issue ID>\",\n      \"domain\" : \"<Domain of the issue>\n    }\n\nCall the `external_api_call` tool with the appropriate profile to report the bug with below inputs\n{\n  \"issue_id\": \"<Issue ID>\",\n  \"profile_id\": \"sbox-ai-agent-qa_profile_20250717081837494-ec8cf4fe6b36323\",\n  \"domain\": \"<Domain>\"\n}\nSTRICTLY USE actual values of Issue ID and domain placeholders with exact values.\n\nOnce Bug reported successfully - Communicate to the user about the same and ALSO send the Issue ID to the user then ask if the user needs more queries and continue with the original flow.\n\n---\n\n<action>\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Bug Reporting Actions\n\n---\n\n### 1.

Using the Mute Feature: One of the quickest ways to address harassment is through the Mute feature\u2014a simple yet effective solution to stop unwanted interactions. Should you encounter a player who is behaving offensively or making you uncomfortable, follow these steps to mute them: 1. Tap on the profile picture of the offending player. 2. Select \"Mute\" from the available options. 3. Confirm the action, and from that point on, you will no longer receive messages or any form of communication from that player Reaching Out to Support: While the Mute feature is a quick fix, we understand the importance of addressing the root cause of the problem. If you've encountered harassment, we encourage you to contact our support team for further action. Here's how you can contact support with details of the incident: 1. Contact our support team directly from within the game. 2. When reporting an incident, provide clear screenshots of the offensive messages for context. 3.

(Yes/No)\u201d\n\n- If the user says **No**, ask for corrections.\n- If the user says **Yes**, proceed to submit the issue.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step 5: Report Bug via External API\n\nOnce the user confirms the issue and its details call `update_cif` with below inputs:\n{\n      \"cif\": {\n        \"issue_type\": {\n          \"type\": \"singleline\",\n          \"value\": \"<user selected option>\n        },\n        \"issue_summary\": {\n          \"type\": \"multiline\",\n          \"value\": \"<AI-generated summary>\"\n        },\n        \"time\": {\n          \"type\": \"singleline\",\n          \"value\": \"<user provided timestamp>\"\n        },\n        \"frequency\": {\n          \"type\": \"singleline\",\n          \"value\": \"<user selected frequency>\"\n        },\n        \"game_version\": {\n          \"type\": \"singleline\",\n          \"value\": \"<game version>\"\n        },\n        \"network_type\": {\n          \"type\": \"singleline\",\n          \"value\": \"<Network Type>\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"issue_id\": \"<Issue ID>\",\n      \"domain\" : \"<Domain of the issue>\n    }\n\nCall the `external_api_call` tool with the appropriate profile to report the bug with below inputs\n{\n  \"issue_id\": \"<Issue ID>\",\n  \"profile_id\": \"sbox-ai-agent-qa_profile_20250717081837494-ec8cf4fe6b36323\",\n  \"domain\": \"<Domain>\"\n}\nSTRICTLY USE actual values of Issue ID and domain placeholders with exact values.\n\nOnce Bug reported successfully - Communicate to the user about the same and ALSO send the Issue ID to the user then ask if the user needs more queries and continue with the original flow.\n\n---\n\n<action>\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Bug Reporting Actions\n\n---\n\n### 1. Users query is a known issue **or if the AI Assistant\u2019s reply indicates that the issue is already recognized, tracked, or being handled by the team in any way,** treat this as a known issue.\n\n\n- `add_private_note` with summary of user problem\n- `update_tag` with tags: [\"bug-report\", \"known-issue\"]\n- `update_cif`:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"issue_type\": {\n      \"type\": \"singleline\",\n      \"value\": \"Report Technical Issues or Bugs\"\n    },\n    \"issue_sub_type\": {\n      \"type\": \"singleline\",\n      \"value\": \"Known Issue\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n- Based on user's choice:\n    - If user wants escalation:\n      - `escalate_issue` (communicated escalation to user)\n    - If user does not want escalation:\n      -`resolve_issue` (communicated resolution to user)\n---\n\n### 2. Bug Reported Successfully\n\nWhen the Bug has been reported successfully by the assistant(Check the lastest assistant message) then call the below tools:\n- `add_private_note` with note_text: Action Needed! Detailed Summary of user\u2019s problem(including time, frequency, game version)\n- `update_tag` with: [\"bug-report\", \"jira-ticket-created\",\"new-issue\", \"<type-specific-tag>\"]\n    Where <type-specific-tag> is one of:\n        - purchase-issue\n        - account-issue\n        - rewards-issue\n        - performance-issue\n        - gameplay-issue\n        - community-issue\n        - other-issue\n- `update_cif`:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"issue_type\": {\n      \"type\": \"singleline\",\n      \"value\": \"Report Technical Issues or Bugs\"\n    },\n    \"issue_sub_type\": {\n      \"type\": \"singleline\",\n      \"value\": \"New issue\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n**These should be STRICTLY only called once after the Bug report has been successful and Issue has been shared with the user.**\n---\n\n### 3. Escalation Conditions\n\nTrigger `escalate_issue` to queue if:\n- User explicitly requests human help.\n- Repeated confusion or inability to validate details.\n\n---\n**Final Reminders**\n- Do NOT miss or mix any actions.\n- Always take actions based on the scenario.\n- Always invoke update_tag and all other required tools, even if you escalate or resolve the issue. These actions must never be skipped or delayed.\n\n</action>"}, "isError": false}, "tool_status": "success"}, {"tool_name": "get_faqs", "tool_args": {"domain": "sbox-ai-agent-regression", "profile_id": "sbox-ai-agent-regression_profile_20251127100814952-84871c18824deea", "query": "bug in game", "published_only": false, "top_k": 3, "issue_pid": 2018, "languages_supported": ["en"], "app_id": "sbox-ai-agent-regression_app_20251127084730160-480c6a03310f7bb"}, "tool_output": {"content": [{"type": "text", "text": {"status": "Success", "faqs_list": [{"id": "sbox-ai-agent-regression_faq_20251210114547559-27601eecd26e3c2", "title": "General troubleshooting", "faq_body": "If your game is freezing, crashing, not loading, or behaving irregularly we recommend that you try the following steps: Please close all of you running apps and restart your device.

Confirm the action, and from that point on, you will no longer receive messages or any form of communication from that player Reaching Out to Support: While the Mute feature is a quick fix, we understand the importance of addressing the root cause of the problem. If you've encountered harassment, we encourage you to contact our support team for further action. Here's how you can contact support with details of the incident: 1. Contact our support team directly from within the game. 2. When reporting an incident, provide clear screenshots of the offensive messages for context. 3.

The EU Digital Services Act is a legislative framework proposed by the European Union to update and enhance regulations on digital services. Addressing illegal content aims to create a safer and more accountable online environment. The DSA focuses on several key objectives such as: - Ensuring online safety by combating illegal content. - Increasing transparency and accountability of digital services. - Protecting fundamental rights of users. Illegal Content under DSA - for users in European Union How to report Illegal Content? Users located in the European Union can report Illegal Content via Player Support directly through the game's automated support system or via our web Huuuge Games Support Portal or via e-mail support@huuugegames.com It\u2019s important that you include in your report the following information, so we can act accordingly: -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 explain clearly why you deem the content is illegal, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 specify the location and details of the allegedly illegal content, e.g. \u00a0the exact URL(s) (if applicable) or other information to identify illegal content such as screenshots. -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 provide us with your name and e-mail address, except where the illegal content refers to offences concerning children sexual abuse, child pornography or similar, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 state that your report is done in a good faith, accurate and complete. What is Illegal Content? Illegal content that potentially may occur e.g. in our chat or club, content provided by our users, as defined by the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), includes information that does not comply with EU law or specific national laws within the EU. Illegality of the content can also originate from the principles of social coexistence. Here are some examples that may help you understand what content may be deemed illegal by us if reported: 1. Hate Speech Content that includes incitement to violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other characteristics protected under EU law. 2. Terrorism-related Content Content that promotes, supports, or incites terrorist activities or provides instructions for making explosives, weapons, or other dangerous substances. 3. Child Sexual Abuse Material Any material that depicts the sexual exploitation or abuse of children, including images, videos, or written content. 4. Counterfeit Goods Listings for the sale of counterfeit goods that infringe on intellectual property rights, such as fake branded clothes, electronics, or pharmaceuticals. 5. Fraudulent Schemes Content that promotes scams or fraudulent activities, including phishing schemes, pyramid schemes, and deceptive financial services. 6. Drugs and Illicit Substances Content that sells, offers, or promotes the use or distribution of illegal drugs or controlled substances. 7. Defamation and Invasion of Privacy Content that unlawfully defames individuals or invades their privacy, including unauthorized sharing of personal data, images, or videos. 8. Incitement to Self-Harm Content that encourages or instructs individuals to self-harm or commit suicide. It's important to note that the definition of illegal content can vary based on specific national laws within the EU. 9. Cyberstalking Using of digital communication tools to harass, intimidate, or threaten someone. It often involves repeated, unwanted contact, monitoring, or the spread of harmful information. Remember that the content or conduct highlighted above is only an illustration. How do we act in cases of Illegal Content? We will investigate and act accordingly to prevent Illegal Content in the following cases: -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when we receive report from a user, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when we receive report form an authority, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when we detect the Illegal Content by ourselves via our human reviewers or potentially when we employ automatic tools to moderate content. We have the right to impose the following restrictions on the user that disseminates Illegal content: removal of the content, temporary blocking (mute) the services for the user, suspension and/or termination of the services, prohibition of the future access to our services. Please also consult Section 13 of our Terms of Use for more information about conduct and prohibited use. Upon implementation restriction on the user disseminating Illegal Content, we will provide the statement of reasons. Users that do not agree with the restrictions imposed by us as a result of the above procedure have the right to file a complaint through the game's automated support system or online at Huuuge Games Support Portal . Please provide all the details regarding your complaint against the restrictions imposed by us as a result of this procedure so we are able to review it accordingly.

The EU Digital Services Act is a legislative framework proposed by the European Union to update and enhance regulations on digital services. Addressing illegal content aims to create a safer and more accountable online environment. The DSA focuses on several key objectives such as: - Ensuring online safety by combating illegal content. - Increasing transparency and accountability of digital services. - Protecting fundamental rights of users. Illegal Content under DSA - for users in European Union How to report Illegal Content? Users located in the European Union can report Illegal Content via Player Support directly through the game's automated support system or via our web Huuuge Games Support Portal or via e-mail support@huuugegames.com It\u2019s important that you include in your report the following information, so we can act accordingly: -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 explain clearly why you deem the content is illegal, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 specify the location and details of the allegedly illegal content, e.g. \u00a0the exact URL(s) (if applicable) or other information to identify illegal content such as screenshots. -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 provide us with your name and e-mail address, except where the illegal content refers to offences concerning children sexual abuse, child pornography or similar, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 state that your report is done in a good faith, accurate and complete. What is Illegal Content? Illegal content that potentially may occur e.g. in our chat or club, content provided by our users, as defined by the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), includes information that does not comply with EU law or specific national laws within the EU. Illegality of the content can also originate from the principles of social coexistence. Here are some examples that may help you understand what content may be deemed illegal by us if reported: 1. Hate Speech Content that includes incitement to violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other characteristics protected under EU law. 2. Terrorism-related Content Content that promotes, supports, or incites terrorist activities or provides instructions for making explosives, weapons, or other dangerous substances. 3. Child Sexual Abuse Material Any material that depicts the sexual exploitation or abuse of children, including images, videos, or written content. 4. Counterfeit Goods Listings for the sale of counterfeit goods that infringe on intellectual property rights, such as fake branded clothes, electronics, or pharmaceuticals. 5. Fraudulent Schemes Content that promotes scams or fraudulent activities, including phishing schemes, pyramid schemes, and deceptive financial services. 6. Drugs and Illicit Substances Content that sells, offers, or promotes the use or distribution of illegal drugs or controlled substances. 7. Defamation and Invasion of Privacy Content that unlawfully defames individuals or invades their privacy, including unauthorized sharing of personal data, images, or videos. 8. Incitement to Self-Harm Content that encourages or instructs individuals to self-harm or commit suicide. It's important to note that the definition of illegal content can vary based on specific national laws within the EU. 9. Cyberstalking Using of digital communication tools to harass, intimidate, or threaten someone. It often involves repeated, unwanted contact, monitoring, or the spread of harmful information. Remember that the content or conduct highlighted above is only an illustration. How do we act in cases of Illegal Content? We will investigate and act accordingly to prevent Illegal Content in the following cases: -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when we receive report from a user, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when we receive report form an authority, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when we detect the Illegal Content by ourselves via our human reviewers or potentially when we employ automatic tools to moderate content. We have the right to impose the following restrictions on the user that disseminates Illegal content: removal of the content, temporary blocking (mute) the services for the user, suspension and/or termination of the services, prohibition of the future access to our services. Please also consult Section 13 of our Terms of Use for more information about conduct and prohibited use. Upon implementation restriction on the user disseminating Illegal Content, we will provide the statement of reasons. Users that do not agree with the restrictions imposed by us as a result of the above procedure have the right to file a complaint through the game's automated support system or online at Huuuge Games Support Portal . Please provide all the details regarding your complaint against the restrictions imposed by us as a result of this procedure so we are able to review it accordingly.

The EU Digital Services Act is a legislative framework proposed by the European Union to update and enhance regulations on digital services. Addressing illegal content aims to create a safer and more accountable online environment. The DSA focuses on several key objectives such as: - Ensuring online safety by combating illegal content. - Increasing transparency and accountability of digital services. - Protecting fundamental rights of users. Illegal Content under DSA - for users in European Union How to report Illegal Content? Users located in the European Union can report Illegal Content via Player Support directly through the game's automated support system or via our web Huuuge Games Support Portal or via e-mail support@huuugegames.com It\u2019s important that you include in your report the following information, so we can act accordingly: -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 explain clearly why you deem the content is illegal, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 specify the location and details of the allegedly illegal content, e.g. \u00a0the exact URL(s) (if applicable) or other information to identify illegal content such as screenshots. -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 provide us with your name and e-mail address, except where the illegal content refers to offences concerning children sexual abuse, child pornography or similar, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 state that your report is done in a good faith, accurate and complete. What is Illegal Content? Illegal content that potentially may occur e.g. in our chat or club, content provided by our users, as defined by the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), includes information that does not comply with EU law or specific national laws within the EU. Illegality of the content can also originate from the principles of social coexistence. Here are some examples that may help you understand what content may be deemed illegal by us if reported: 1. Hate Speech Content that includes incitement to violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other characteristics protected under EU law. 2. Terrorism-related Content Content that promotes, supports, or incites terrorist activities or provides instructions for making explosives, weapons, or other dangerous substances. 3. Child Sexual Abuse Material Any material that depicts the sexual exploitation or abuse of children, including images, videos, or written content. 4. Counterfeit Goods Listings for the sale of counterfeit goods that infringe on intellectual property rights, such as fake branded clothes, electronics, or pharmaceuticals. 5. Fraudulent Schemes Content that promotes scams or fraudulent activities, including phishing schemes, pyramid schemes, and deceptive financial services. 6. Drugs and Illicit Substances Content that sells, offers, or promotes the use or distribution of illegal drugs or controlled substances. 7. Defamation and Invasion of Privacy Content that unlawfully defames individuals or invades their privacy, including unauthorized sharing of personal data, images, or videos. 8. Incitement to Self-Harm Content that encourages or instructs individuals to self-harm or commit suicide. It's important to note that the definition of illegal content can vary based on specific national laws within the EU. 9. Cyberstalking Using of digital communication tools to harass, intimidate, or threaten someone. It often involves repeated, unwanted contact, monitoring, or the spread of harmful information. Remember that the content or conduct highlighted above is only an illustration. How do we act in cases of Illegal Content? We will investigate and act accordingly to prevent Illegal Content in the following cases: -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when we receive report from a user, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when we receive report form an authority, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when we detect the Illegal Content by ourselves via our human reviewers or potentially when we employ automatic tools to moderate content. We have the right to impose the following restrictions on the user that disseminates Illegal content: removal of the content, temporary blocking (mute) the services for the user, suspension and/or termination of the services, prohibition of the future access to our services. Please also consult Section 13 of our Terms of Use for more information about conduct and prohibited use. Upon implementation restriction on the user disseminating Illegal Content, we will provide the statement of reasons. Users that do not agree with the restrictions imposed by us as a result of the above procedure have the right to file a complaint through the game's automated support system or online at Huuuge Games Support Portal . Please provide all the details regarding your complaint against the restrictions imposed by us as a result of this procedure so we are able to review it accordingly.

The EU Digital Services Act is a legislative framework proposed by the European Union to update and enhance regulations on digital services. Addressing illegal content aims to create a safer and more accountable online environment. The DSA focuses on several key objectives such as: - Ensuring online safety by combating illegal content. - Increasing transparency and accountability of digital services. - Protecting fundamental rights of users. Illegal Content under DSA - for users in European Union How to report Illegal Content? Users located in the European Union can report Illegal Content via Player Support directly through the game's automated support system or via our web Huuuge Games Support Portal or via e-mail support@huuugegames.com It\u2019s important that you include in your report the following information, so we can act accordingly: -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 explain clearly why you deem the content is illegal, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 specify the location and details of the allegedly illegal content, e.g. \u00a0the exact URL(s) (if applicable) or other information to identify illegal content such as screenshots. -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 provide us with your name and e-mail address, except where the illegal content refers to offences concerning children sexual abuse, child pornography or similar, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 state that your report is done in a good faith, accurate and complete. What is Illegal Content? Illegal content that potentially may occur e.g. in our chat or club, content provided by our users, as defined by the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), includes information that does not comply with EU law or specific national laws within the EU. Illegality of the content can also originate from the principles of social coexistence. Here are some examples that may help you understand what content may be deemed illegal by us if reported: 1. Hate Speech Content that includes incitement to violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other characteristics protected under EU law. 2. Terrorism-related Content Content that promotes, supports, or incites terrorist activities or provides instructions for making explosives, weapons, or other dangerous substances. 3. Child Sexual Abuse Material Any material that depicts the sexual exploitation or abuse of children, including images, videos, or written content. 4. Counterfeit Goods Listings for the sale of counterfeit goods that infringe on intellectual property rights, such as fake branded clothes, electronics, or pharmaceuticals. 5. Fraudulent Schemes Content that promotes scams or fraudulent activities, including phishing schemes, pyramid schemes, and deceptive financial services. 6. Drugs and Illicit Substances Content that sells, offers, or promotes the use or distribution of illegal drugs or controlled substances. 7. Defamation and Invasion of Privacy Content that unlawfully defames individuals or invades their privacy, including unauthorized sharing of personal data, images, or videos. 8. Incitement to Self-Harm Content that encourages or instructs individuals to self-harm or commit suicide. It's important to note that the definition of illegal content can vary based on specific national laws within the EU. 9. Cyberstalking Using of digital communication tools to harass, intimidate, or threaten someone. It often involves repeated, unwanted contact, monitoring, or the spread of harmful information. Remember that the content or conduct highlighted above is only an illustration. How do we act in cases of Illegal Content? We will investigate and act accordingly to prevent Illegal Content in the following cases: -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when we receive report from a user, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when we receive report form an authority, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when we detect the Illegal Content by ourselves via our human reviewers or potentially when we employ automatic tools to moderate content. We have the right to impose the following restrictions on the user that disseminates Illegal content: removal of the content, temporary blocking (mute) the services for the user, suspension and/or termination of the services, prohibition of the future access to our services. Please also consult Section 13 of our Terms of Use for more information about conduct and prohibited use. Upon implementation restriction on the user disseminating Illegal Content, we will provide the statement of reasons. Users that do not agree with the restrictions imposed by us as a result of the above procedure have the right to file a complaint through the game's automated support system or online at Huuuge Games Support Portal . Please provide all the details regarding your complaint against the restrictions imposed by us as a result of this procedure so we are able to review it accordingly. Please also consult Section 15 of our Terms of Use for more information about complaints. Where can I find more information on the DSA?

The EU Digital Services Act is a legislative framework proposed by the European Union to update and enhance regulations on digital services. Addressing illegal content aims to create a safer and more accountable online environment. The DSA focuses on several key objectives such as: - Ensuring online safety by combating illegal content. - Increasing transparency and accountability of digital services. - Protecting fundamental rights of users. Illegal Content under DSA - for users in European Union How to report Illegal Content? Users located in the European Union can report Illegal Content via Player Support directly through the game's automated support system or via our web Huuuge Games Support Portal or via e-mail support@huuugegames.com It\u2019s important that you include in your report the following information, so we can act accordingly: -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 explain clearly why you deem the content is illegal, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 specify the location and details of the allegedly illegal content, e.g. \u00a0the exact URL(s) (if applicable) or other information to identify illegal content such as screenshots. -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 provide us with your name and e-mail address, except where the illegal content refers to offences concerning children sexual abuse, child pornography or similar, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 state that your report is done in a good faith, accurate and complete. What is Illegal Content? Illegal content that potentially may occur e.g. in our chat or club, content provided by our users, as defined by the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), includes information that does not comply with EU law or specific national laws within the EU. Illegality of the content can also originate from the principles of social coexistence. Here are some examples that may help you understand what content may be deemed illegal by us if reported: 1. Hate Speech Content that includes incitement to violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other characteristics protected under EU law. 2. Terrorism-related Content Content that promotes, supports, or incites terrorist activities or provides instructions for making explosives, weapons, or other dangerous substances. 3. Child Sexual Abuse Material Any material that depicts the sexual exploitation or abuse of children, including images, videos, or written content. 4. Counterfeit Goods Listings for the sale of counterfeit goods that infringe on intellectual property rights, such as fake branded clothes, electronics, or pharmaceuticals. 5. Fraudulent Schemes Content that promotes scams or fraudulent activities, including phishing schemes, pyramid schemes, and deceptive financial services. 6. Drugs and Illicit Substances Content that sells, offers, or promotes the use or distribution of illegal drugs or controlled substances. 7. Defamation and Invasion of Privacy Content that unlawfully defames individuals or invades their privacy, including unauthorized sharing of personal data, images, or videos. 8. Incitement to Self-Harm Content that encourages or instructs individuals to self-harm or commit suicide. It's important to note that the definition of illegal content can vary based on specific national laws within the EU. 9. Cyberstalking Using of digital communication tools to harass, intimidate, or threaten someone. It often involves repeated, unwanted contact, monitoring, or the spread of harmful information. Remember that the content or conduct highlighted above is only an illustration. How do we act in cases of Illegal Content? We will investigate and act accordingly to prevent Illegal Content in the following cases: -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when we receive report from a user, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when we receive report form an authority, -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when we detect the Illegal Content by ourselves via our human reviewers or potentially when we employ automatic tools to moderate content. We have the right to impose the following restrictions on the user that disseminates Illegal content: removal of the content, temporary blocking (mute) the services for the user, suspension and/or termination of the services, prohibition of the future access to our services. Please also consult Section 13 of our Terms of Use for more information about conduct and prohibited use. Upon implementation restriction on the user disseminating Illegal Content, we will provide the statement of reasons. Users that do not agree with the restrictions imposed by us as a result of the above procedure have the right to file a complaint through the game's automated support system or online at Huuuge Games Support Portal . Please provide all the details regarding your complaint against the restrictions imposed by us as a result of this procedure so we are able to review it accordingly. Please also consult Section 15 of our Terms of Use for more information about complaints. Where can I find more information on the DSA? For more detailed information, visit the official [European Commission DSA webpage]( https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en ) or consult with legal experts specializing in EU digital regulations. Single point of contact for authorities and users in DSA matters Huuuge has established an electronic point of contact for direct communication with the authorities of the Member States, the European Commission, and the Digital Services Board: support@huuugegames.com . Users can also use this contact for swift and direct communication with Huuuge regarding any DSA issues. Please refer clearly to DSA and provide us with as many details as possible so we can act accordingly. All communication with the point of contact should be conducted in English.
